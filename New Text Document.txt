Dockerfile

Dockerfile is a declarative way of creating our own images.
Docker will give us some syntax to create our own images

1. FROM:

FROM almalinux

Building an image from the dockerfile:
--------------------------------------------------------

command syntax : 

docker build -t [docker-hub-url]/your user name/your image name:version . (dot . ) is compulsory

docker hub url is docker.io

but   need to provide the docker hub url and username also but official images does not have usernames but if we want to pull images with our dockerhub username it is our wish
